                    San Jose, the third largest city in California, is also the most populous component of the extensive metropolitan area around the bay that, in addition to San Francisco, includes Oakland.
                    Neighbouring communities include Milpitas (northeast), Alum Rock (east), Los Gatos (southwest), Campbell and Santa Clara (west), and Sunnyvale (northwest).
                    The city constitutes the hub of Silicon Valley, the region of high-technology and computer-related industries that stretches along the southwestern shore of the bay toward San Francisco.
                    Inc. 1850. Area city, 178 square miles (461 square km). Pop. (2000) 894,943;
                    San Jose–Sunnyvale–Santa Clara Metro Area, 1,735,819; (2010) 945,942;
                    San Jose–Sunnyvale–Santa Clara Metro Area, 1,836,911.

                    <br><br>
                    San Jose’s economy remains heavily focused on high technology.
                    Computer hardware design and manufacturing, software production, and Internet concerns are its major industries.
                    Electronic equipment, semiconductors, scientific instruments, and industrial machinery are produced, and business, health, and engineering services are other important economic factors.
                    The Santa Clara Valley continues to be a productive agricultural area.
                    Major crops include greenhouse plants, cut flowers, mushrooms, and an array of fruits and vegetables (notably wine grapes, cherries, peppers, tomatoes, and lettuce);
                    beef cattle are also raised.
                    <br>
                    The city is home to San Jose State University (1857; part of the California State University system) and San Jose City College (1921);
                    Santa Clara and Stanford universities are nearby.
                    San Jose supports a variety of music, dance, and theatre organizations, including professional ballet and opera companies.
                    Notable museums include the San Jose Museum of Art and the Tech Museum of Innovation.
                    Rosicrucian Park has a museum of Egyptian antiquities and a planetarium and science centre.
                    The Winchester Mystery House, a 160-room Victorian mansion filled with unusual architectural features, was under construction continuously between 1884 and 1922 by the eccentric widow Sarah Winchester, heir to the fortune of the firearms-manufacturing company.
                    It is maintained as a museum, as are Peralta Adobe (1797), the last remaining structure from the original pueblo, and nearby Fallon House (1855), built for one of the city’s first mayors.
                    <br>
                    There is an extensive system of municipal and regional parks.
                    Kelley Park, along Coyote Creek, includes a zoo, a Japanese garden, and an outdoor historic museum of restored and replicated buildings from San Jose’s early years.
                    The 720-acre (290-hectare) Alum Rock Park (1872), on the eastern edge of the city, is California’s oldest municipal park.
                    The city abounds in flower gardens, notably the Municipal Rose Garden and Overfelt Gardens.
                    San Jose is home to the Sharks, the Bay Area’s professional ice hockey team.
                    Several state parks are in the vicinity, including Henry W. Coe (southeast) and Big Basin Redwoods (southwest).
                    Lick Observatory is located on Mount Hamilton, about 15 miles (25 km) east of the city.

                    San Francisco, city and port, coextensive with San Francisco county, northern California, U.S., located on a peninsula between the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay.
                    It is a cultural and financial centre of the western United States and one of the country’s most cosmopolitan cities.
                    Area 46 square miles (120 square km). Pop. (2000) 776,733;
                    San Francisco–San Mateo–Redwood City Metro Division, 1,731,183;
                    San Francisco–Oakland–Fremont Metro Area, 4,123,740;
                    (2010) 805,235;
                    San Francisco–San Mateo–Redwood City Metro Division, 1,776,095;
                    San Francisco–Oakland–Fremont Metro Area, 4,335,391.
                    <br><br>
                    <span>City site</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Hilly and roughly square, San Francisco occupies the northern tip of a peninsula.
                    To its south are the bedroom suburbs of San Mateo county, to the east and northeast is the bay, and to the west and northwest lies the Pacific Ocean.
                    <br>
                    The most prominent of San Francisco’s hills are Twin Peaks, Mount Davidson, and Mount Sutro, all of which exceed 900 feet (270 metres) in elevation.
                    The best known are Nob Hill, where the wealthy “nobs” (nabobs) built extravagant mansions in the 1870s, and Telegraph Hill, which once looked down on the Barbary Coast, a neighbourhood formerly alive with gaudy wickedness.
                    As a result of the pioneer planners’ prejudice in favour of a squared-off grid, the downtown streets march intrepidly up precipitous slopes, terrifying newly arrived drivers, making the cable cars more than sentimental anachronisms, and providing splendid views of the bay.
                    <br>
                    San Francisco Bay is a drowned river valley, submerged during the melting of the last glacial ice sheet.
                    Enthusiastic and profitable filling of the tidelands has reduced its area at mean high tide from about 700 square miles (1,800 square km) in 1880 to a mere 435 square miles (1,125 square km).
                    More than half of the bay is still fillable, but in 1965 the state legislature created the Bay Conservation and Development Commission to control further landfill projects.
                    At its widest extent the bay measures 13 miles (21 km) across;
                    its deepest point, 357 feet (109 metres), is in the Golden Gate, a narrow channel between the peninsula and Marin county to the north that connects the bay to the Pacific.
                    The maximum daily flow of water through the Golden Gate into the Pacific is seven times the flow of the Mississippi River at its mouth.
                    <br>
                    Within the portion of San Francisco Bay lying inside the city limits are the natural islands of Alcatraz and Yerba Buena and man-made Treasure Island, created for a world’s fair in 1939 and later turned into a naval base (1941–93).
                    Alcatraz (Spanish: “Pelican”) was from 1934 to 1963 the most notorious maximum-security, “escape-proof” prison in the United States.
                    In 1969, after the decaying cell blocks had been given up by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a multi-tribal group of Native Americans invaded the island and asserted their rights to abandoned federal property, but they were forcibly evicted in 1971.
                    The island became part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972 and has become a popular tourist attraction.

                    Los Angeles , city, seat of Los Angeles county, southern California, U.S.
                    It is the second most populous city and metropolitan area (after New York City) in the United States.
                    The city sprawls across a broad coastal plain situated between mountains and the Pacific Ocean;
                    the much larger Los Angeles county, which encompasses the city, contains some 90 other incorporated cities, including Beverly Hills, Pasadena, and Long Beach.
                    The county also encompasses two of the Channel Islands, Santa Catalina and San Clemente;
                    Mount San Antonio, familiarly known as Mount Baldy or Old Baldy, 10,046 feet (3,062 metres) high;
                    more than 900 square miles (2,330 square km) of desert;
                    and 75 miles (120 km) of seacoast.
                    <br>
                    Since the city and the county are interwoven geographically, culturally, and economically, any consideration of Los Angeles must, to some degree, involve both entities.
                    Population density around the metropolitan area varies greatly—as low as one person per square mile in mountainous areas and as high as 50,000 per square mile near downtown Los Angeles.
                    Area city, 466 square miles (1,207 square km);
                    county, 4,070 square miles (10,540 square km).

                    <br><br>
                    Los Angeles county is a vast and varied geographic entity.
                    It includes a group of inland valleys, a coastal plain separated by low mountains that are interspersed with steep passes, an arc of still higher mountains, and a long seacoast.
                    Nearly half of the county is taken up by mountain chains—most of them running east-west—that have a dynamic history of earthquakes, firestorms, and mud slides.
                    To the north and northeast are the massive and sprawling San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains.
                    Stretching in front of them—and more or less in parallel lines from west to east—are the Santa Monica Mountains, Puente Hills, Repetto Hills, and San Jose Hills.
                    These chains delineate the San Fernando, San Gabriel, and San Bernardino valleys.
                    Farther south—running roughly between Orange and Riverside counties—are the Santa Ana Mountains.
                    A magnificent natural feature of Los Angeles county is the coastline’s distinctive beaches, which attract millions of sun worshippers annually.
                    <br>
                    Three waterways cross the county: the westward-flowing Santa Clara River in the north;
                    the Los Angeles River in the south, extending from the San Fernando Valley east and south to the Pacific Ocean;
                    and the San Gabriel River, which rises from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north and flows south to the ocean.
                    Huge floods have periodically inundated large parts of Los Angeles, and much human effort has gone into confining the waterways within concrete channels.
                    In historic times (1825) a deluge permanently shifted the direction of the Los Angeles River channel from its westward outflow into Santa Monica Bay to a south-flowing outlet emptying into San Pedro Bay.
                    In the winter of 1861–62, a flood left the western part of the Los Angeles basin looking like a chain of lakes dotted with islands.
                    The San Gabriel River also overflowed its banks and at one point merged with the Los Angeles River via a new channel called the Rio Hondo.
                    <br>
                    The huge, sprawling, and tortuously shaped city of Los Angeles occupies a sizable portion of the southern part of the county.
                    It too has a varied topography, climbing from sea level at the beach community of Venice to Mount Lukens, which rises above 5,100 feet (1,550 metres).
                    The city started in 1781 as a tiny village of 28 square miles (73 square km) but expanded greatly through a series of annexations when it first established an ironclad legal monopoly over the Los Angeles River watershed and then brought in a new water supply from the Owens River (which rises from the Sierra Nevada, 230 miles [370 km] northeast of the city).
                    To share in this scarce water resource—and to receive much-needed police and fire protection—neighbouring communities elected to join the city.
                    The annexations of Wilmington and San Pedro and a connecting narrow “shoestring” of land (1909–10) resulted when Los Angeles created a harbour and linked it to the city proper.
                    By 1917 Los Angeles had tripled in size by adding the entire San Fernando Valley and the district of Palms.
                    Between 1922 and 1928, 34 unincorporated areas and five cities merged with Los Angeles.
                    As it grew, Los Angeles encircled five independent cities—Beverly Hills, Culver City, West Hollywood, Universal City, and San Fernando.
                    <br>
                    Original city districts and annexed communities—Boyle Heights, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Hollywood, San Pedro, Encino, and Watts, for example—still retain their community names and identities.
                    On the other hand, the city never recognized neighbourhoods as such, so these smaller units have only vague and informal boundaries.

        <br>
        <p>
            San Jose, this city immediately takes all the attention to itself.
            And indeed, when we arrived in this city, we immediately began to look around, first of all, of course, because we realized that we were in the USA, and secondly, because there were more programmers in this city than in any other place on earth.
            Here at every corner are giant companies that essentially control the modern world and the development of trends.
            And I am extremely grateful to fate that I had the opportunity to see the offices of these companies, as well as to go on excursions in such a company as Google and walk between the buildings of Apple.

        <p>
            San Francisco, a city of contrasts and thousands of lights.
            And this is really so, when we arrived we simply ran our eyes, because wherever you look you see places from films, games, TV shows and just what you used to see only in pictures on the Internet.
            When we stood near Lombard Street, we were shocked how beautiful and magnificent this city was.
            You look back and see the Golden Gate Bridge, you look to the left you see the very famous Alcatraz prison, and when you look directly you see the most winding street in the world that goes down and at the very end of this street you see how the cruise ship stands.
            And to be honest, I'm not surprised that this city falls in love with itself and stay forever in our hearts.

        <p>
            Los Angeles, this city was simply created to write books, make films, create games and just enjoy the luxurious life in it.
            When we arrived, a stingy male tear even slipped through my soul, because I had seen this city in films, in games, and I never thought that I would have the chance to see it with my own eyes.
            The city is simply amazing in its scale, it is so huge that life is not enough to just walk on every street of it.
            We were only 3 days old and saw only the most popular places, such as Santa Monica Beach, the Walk of Fame, the Hollywood sign, Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive and touched Down Town quite a bit.
            But this is even for the best, because there is a motivation to return to this city again and again.
